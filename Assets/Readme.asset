  - heading: Welcome to the Multiplayer FPS template
    text: "This template is a complete, production\u2011ready foundation for building
      networked shooters with Unity\u2019s DOTS stack. With Netcode for Entities,
      GhostBridge\u2019s hybrid authoring, and a clear scene and prefab structure,
      it serves as a practical guide to ECS\u2011driven architecture, gameplay systems,
      and multiplayer synchronization. The template supports dedicated server builds
      across platforms and includes developer\u2011oriented examples\u2014such as
      ghost authoring, RPCs, and server bootstrap workflows\u2014to help teams prototype
      quickly, learn best practices, and scale to real\u2011world projects."
